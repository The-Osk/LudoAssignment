I Used grid of cells to determine the locition of each move for the piece, the cell compantant is only for position now but it can be filled with extra data like: piece in the cell and is the cell a safe zone
The dice animation is a random switch between the dice's sprites with a delay inbetween
The piece moving animation is a jump animation made using DOTWEEN
